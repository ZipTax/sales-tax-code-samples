# Sales Tax Automation Code Samples

Welcome to the official `sales-tax-code-samples` repository! This repository contains examples of how to integrate and automate sales tax calculations using the [zip.tax API](https://zip.tax/). These code samples are designed to help developers quickly implement and adapt the API in their applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Sample integrations in multiple programming languages.
- Demonstrates key API functionalities, including:
  - **Sales Tax Calculation**: Retrieve accurate tax rates based on location.
  - **Address Lookup**: Fetch tax details by location street address.
  - **Address Normalization (geolocation)**: Get the USPS normalized address and lat/long details based on a partial or non-normalized address.
  - **Compliance and Updates**: Access real-time updates to stay compliant with changing tax regulations.
- Simplified examples to get started quickly.
